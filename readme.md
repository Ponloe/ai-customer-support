# **FastAPI-based Chatbot Backend with Google Gemini Integration**

This code creates a backend API for a chatbot application using FastAPI that interfaces with Google's Gemini AI model. Here's how it works:

## **Key Components**

1. **Imports and Setup**:
    - FastAPI: Web framework for building APIs
    - google.generativeai: Google's Gemini AI client library
    - dotenv: Loads environment variables from a .env file
    - CORSMiddleware: Enables cross-origin resource sharing
2. **Environment Configuration**:
    - Loads the Gemini API key securely from environment variables
    - Configures the Gemini client with this API key
    - Sets up the `gemini-2.0-flash` model for text generation
3. **FastAPI Application**:
    - Creates a new FastAPI instance
    - Configures CORS to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000` (frontend)
4. **Chat Endpoint**:
    - Creates a POST endpoint at `/chat`
    - Accepts JSON data containing a "question" field
    - Validates the question isn't empty
    - Passes the question to the Gemini model
    - Returns the AI-generated response as JSON

## **Flow of Execution**

1. When a POST request is made to `/chat`, the function extracts the question from the request body
2. It performs basic validation (checking if the question exists)
3. The question is sent to Google's Gemini model for processing
4. The text response from Gemini is returned to the client

This simple API allows a frontend application to leverage Google's Gemini AI for generating responses to user questions.
